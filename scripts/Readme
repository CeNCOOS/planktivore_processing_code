Code for processing raw planktivore "tif" images into full color "png" and "jpeg" images.
The json_files are variables to be fed to the code to set some of the processing parameters so that they are not hard coded.

The code was designed for the MBARI/Synchro missions.
For October 2025 an offset between the LRAUV clock and the clock used for the Planktivore file names was discovered.
Bespoke files to process this one set of data have been added and have had "oct2025" appended to the names.  
Due to a quick turn around the "high_mag_cam" and "low_mag_cam" expression was hard coded in to these particular files.
It needs to be adjusted as needed for the type of files that are being processed.  It is hoped that this is a one-off problem.
